### Fastman92 Processor GUI Tool

The **Fastman92 Processor GUI** is a user-friendly graphical interface designed to simplify the usage of the Fastman92 Processor tool. This tool allows users to convert game files between different formats (such as `.ipl` and `.ide`), change input/output types (binary or text), and adjust file settings for different GTA game versions, including **GTA IV, GTA SA, and GTA VC**. By providing a structured GUI, users can easily select files, configure settings, and execute conversions without needing to use the command line.

### Explanation of the Code:

The provided Python script creates a **GUI-based tool** using **Tkinter** to interact with the Fastman92 Processor. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

1. **GUI Structure:**
   - The interface consists of multiple sections:
     - **File Selection:** Allows users to browse and select input/output files.
     - **Conversion Options:** Lets users define file types, input/output formats, and game versions.
     - **Advanced Options:** Provides additional settings like string lists, position adjustments, and extra arguments.
     - **Log Output:** Displays logs of executed commands and results.

2. **Main Functionalities:**
   - Users can select files via the `filedialog` module.
   - Various settings like file type (`ipl`, `ide`), input/output type (`binary`, `text`), and game versions can be selected using dropdown menus.
   - The tool constructs a command-line string for `fastman92_processor.exe` and runs it using `subprocess.run()`.
   - Execution logs are displayed in a text box for user reference.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - The script ensures necessary fields are filled before running a command.
   - If invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect move position format) are detected, error messages are displayed using `messagebox.showerror()`.
